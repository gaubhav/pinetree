                    <p class="rounded"> Highly recommend the Pine Tree for anyone looking for unique invites (not the usual run-of-the mill stuff), for managing an event effortlessly and most importantly getting the gifts that you want! For the first time, we actually got gifts that we wanted for our son! How often does that happen? No duplicates, no waste and a child who was thrilled to receive gifts to his liking! </p>

                    <p class="rounded"> I used Pine tree for my son's birthday party and found it extremely easy to use. It was simple to create the event, send out the invites and manage it subsequently through features such as RSVP. Making gifting more meaningful is at the heart of what pine tree is all about. As a host I found it extremely easy to create a wishlist, while as a guest I found it extremely time saving to pick up gifts without having to exercise my discretion and judgment. </p>

                    <p class="rounded"> The Pine Tree helped me solve a problem that I faced every time there was an event like a birthday party. I would rather receive gifts of things that I want than accumulate gifts that I might not use. Ensuring that we created a wishlist on Pine Tree helped us receive many of the gifts that we knew we wanted. It's a great product and with the many new features that the team is constantly building, it's only getting better and better. </p>

                    <p class="rounded"> Pine Tree was easy to use and is a perfect medium to wish for gifts of choice for the recipient.<br />
                        I used Pine Tree for my son’s birthday (actually my 10 year old used it )and he absolutely loved it !!!<br />
                        Since it is user friendly, I let my son handle everything right from creating the invites to making the wishlist and I must say he got glued to it. He not only enjoyed his birthday but also thoroughly enjoyed the process of creating his wishlist etc; so the excitement started much before his birthday.<br />
                        It is a wonderful, practical concept and helps avoid duplicate gifts that otherwise end up on kids birthdays or many occasion. I used to get calls from kids' mommies about what my son would like for his birthday and this time when we sent out the invites that had the wishlist, the mommies just loved the concept and thanked me as they did n't have to “think” about what to buy. </p>
